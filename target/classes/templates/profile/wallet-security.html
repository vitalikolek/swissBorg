                            Cryptocurrencies are innovative digital assets. They're a
                            great way to participate in trustless financial ecosystems.
                            However, asset security that's based on cryptographic functions
                            and data protection is one of the major challenges for the industry.
                            Cryptography leverages extensively tested and widely accepted
                            encryption standards (SHA-256 hash and ECDSA encryption). But
                            data security, including private keys and passwords, remains the
                            weak link. Offline asset storage, also known as cold wallet systems,
                            (not connected to the internet at all) are designed to counter these concerns.

                            Our security program encompasses all aspects: platform,

                            approach and see for yourself that your crypto is safe with us.

                                <li>The two AES password owners are prohibited from traveling together or using the same vehicle.</li>
                                <li>The addresses and their encrypted private keys on the offline computer are only accessible via QR codes.</li>

                            Offline asset storage — cold wallets — are the safest vaults for cryptocurrency.
                            But crypto exchanges require ready access to some funds to deposit and withdraw
                            funds for users. It's possible thanks to online storage known as hot wallets.
                            Since hot wallet systems are connected to the internet, operating them safely is
                            a bigger challenge. We created our own semi-offline multi-signature mechanism.
                            It supports quick, secure, and convenient deposits and withdrawals.
